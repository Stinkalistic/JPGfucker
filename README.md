# JPGfucker
A python script that corrupts JPG files to change how they look

# How To Use
Run the file (.py or .exe) and enter the name of the jpg file you want to corrupt. It should be in the same directory as jpgfucker.
Next enter how much you want to corrupt it, represented as integer. If you only want to corrupt it a small amount, choose a small number like 2 or 3. 
If you want it to look completely different, choose a higher number like 10 or more. Please note that a very high number is likely to break the image,
making it unable to be viewed.  The program will create a new image in directory titled "fucked up (your file name).jpg". If you would like to corrupt
it further you can enter another number to corrupt it even more.
